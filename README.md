# QuestShare

### A free lightweight solution for polling momentary feedback. Heavily inspired by web services such as StrawPoll and PollTab.


## Project has been moved!
Planning for the long term, the AWS deployment for QuestShare will be torn down and be replaced with Heroku to prevent charges from incurring.
